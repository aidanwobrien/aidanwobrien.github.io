To date I have lead in the securement and stewardship of thousands of acres of ecologically critical land. I have removed several acres of invasive species, planted thousands of native plants, shrubs and trees and produced hundreds of print and web-map products.

I have an extensive technical background in conservation biology, GIS, spatial analysis, land securement and stewardship. Currently I work for the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust coordinating land securement projects across the Greenbelt and ORM.

I recently finished my Masters in the Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics at the University of Guelph. I studied the adoption and use of information technologies to inform conservation decision-making at several scales. Specifically, I explored opportunities and barriers surrounding the adoption of precision conservation technologies (particularly profit and soil mapping) within the agricultural sector of Southern Ontario by conducting semi-structured interviews, Q and Map Surveys. You can access my thesis ["Evaluating Opportunities and Barriers to Soil Organic Carbon Decision-Support Systems: Integrating salience, credibility and legitimacy" here](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/26394)

Previously, I worked for the Nature Conservancy of Canada as a Conservation Technician. It was during this position that I became interested in working with agricultural stakeholders to implement conservation projects. Further, I have worked with the Ontario Heritage Trust to manage natural heritage properties throughout the province. I have also lead stewardship activities in northern Ontario, worked as a park ranger in the backcountry of Algonquin Park and coordinated conservation outreach events in Toronto and the GTA. 

In 2016, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a BSc in Conservation Biology and Biological Anthropology. I have an extensive technical background in conservation biology and conducted an undergraduate research project on the prevalence and intensity of blackspot parasites in Lake Opeongo. I also have practical experience identifying species in Ontario, resolving environmental conflicts, and have a strong understanding of environmental policy and enforcement within Ontario.

I am an outgoing and friendly individual who enjoys working with people, especially in the outdoors. I have a thirst for knowledge and strive to stay informed with current conservation issues in Canada and around the world. I am extremely interested in sustainable agriculture landscapes, and conservation by design. I am also a vegetarian, cyclist, gardener, paddler, musician and naturalist.

I am always looking for new opportunities in the environmental sector and am always interested in learning more about conservation sciences and its several disciplines. Please feel free to connect with me at aidan.w.obrien@gmail.com or give me a call at (647) 937-7866.
