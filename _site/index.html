<p> Hello! I am a geographer and lifelong learner fascinated by the use and impact of data technologies on environmental decision-making. I am privileged and motivated to work on behalf of (and for the benefit of) Planet Earth.</p>

<p> To date, I have lead in the securement and stewardship of hundreds of acres of ecologically critical properties on the land now known as Southern Ontario. I have an extensive technical background in conservation biology, GIS, spatial analysis, land securement and stewardship. I analyze spatial data and design maps, graphs, visualizations and other tools and data pipelines to support environmental decision-making and nature-based climate solutions. I have also coordinated the removal of several acres of invasive species, the planting of thousands of native plants, shrubs and trees and the design of hundreds of print and web-map products./p>

<p> I strive to work with open-source tools and typically work in QGIS and Python (pandas/geopandas, plotly, folium, dash, seaborn) as well as some Jupyter Notebooks and HTML/JS/CSS. I currently work as a GIS / Database Technician with [Forests Ontario](https://www.forestsontario.ca/) to support restoration, communications and education programs.</p>

<p> Recently I worked for the [Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust](https://www.oakridgesmoraine.org/) coordinating land securement projects across the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine.</p>
    
<p> I finished my Masters in the <a href="https://geg.uoguelph.ca/">Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics</a> at the University of Guelph. I studied the adoption and use of information technologies to inform conservation decision-making at several scales. Specifically, I explored opportunities and barriers surrounding the adoption of precision conservation technologies (particularly profit and soil mapping) within the agricultural sector of Southern Ontario by conducting semi-structured interviews, Q and Map Surveys. You can access my thesis here: <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/26394">“Evaluating Opportunities and Barriers to Soil Organic Carbon Decision-Support Systems: Integrating salience, credibility and legitimacy”</a></p>

<p> Previously, I worked for the <a href="https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/where-we-work/ontario/">Nature Conservancy of Canada</a> as a Conservation Technician. It was during this position that I became interested in working with agricultural stakeholders to implement conservation projects. Further, I have worked with the <a href="https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/">Ontario Heritage Trust</a> to manage natural heritage properties throughout the province. I have also lead stewardship activities in northern Ontario, worked as a park ranger in the backcountry of Algonquin Park and coordinated conservation outreach events in Toronto and the GTA.</p>

<p> In 2016, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a BSc in Conservation Biology and Biological Anthropology. I have an extensive technical background in conservation biology and conducted an undergraduate research project at the <a href="https://www.harkness.ca/">Harkness Fisheries Laboratory</a> on the prevalence and intensity of blackspot parasites in Lake Opeongo. I also have practical experience identifying species in Ontario, resolving environmental conflicts, and have a strong understanding of environmental policy and enforcement within Ontario.</p>

<p> I am an outgoing and friendly individual who enjoys working with people, especially in the outdoors. I have a thirst for knowledge and strive to stay informed with current conservation issues in Canada and around the world. I am extremely passionate about conserving natural and cultural heritage in ways that are respectful, effective and equitable. I currently reside, create and play on Treaty 3 Lands also known as Guelph, Ontario. I am also a vegetarian, cyclist, coder, gardener, paddler, musician, cartographer and naturalist.</p>

<p> I am always looking for new opportunities in the environmental sector and am always interested in learning more about conservation sciences and its several disciplines. Please feel free to connect with me at aidan.w.obrien@gmail.com or give me a call at (647) 937-7866.</p>
